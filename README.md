## Introduction

CollabArt is a four player real-time drawing game, where artistic and teamwork skills are put to the test. Every player is given a specific prompt and allotted only 60 seconds to showcase their creativity. When the timer's up, the drawings are combined into a singular masterpiece, where players can *admire* the outcome of synergy and skill.
