## Introduction

CollabArt is a four player real-time drawing game, where artistic and teamwork skills are put to the test. Every player is given a specific prompt and allotted only 60 seconds to showcase their creativity. When the timer's up, the drawings are combined into a singular masterpiece, where players can *admire* the outcome of synergy and skill.

## Playing the Game

While drawing, users have the flexibility of alternating between brush sizes and color to best draw the prompt quickly and effectively. There are additional options for clearing the screen or submitting early. Once the timer is up or all four players have submitted, users can view the combined artwork alongside the full prompt.
